# COVID-19_Simulation

◇ This project presents a contagion simulation of the COVID-19 virus by its diverse variants. 
  This program includes this variants: chinese, brithish and south africa.
  In order to use the system, the user must upload the settlement list that describe the map. 
  The user can upload the map by clicking on the "File" in menu bar and choosing the "load" option.
  The user can upload "SettlementList" txt file.
  After the map is loaded the user can watch the map.
  At the beggining all the settlements initialize with green color in the map.

◇ In order to start the simulation the user must to click on "play" in "Simulation" in menu bar. After that the user can watch the simulatiton and look on the details in the "Statistic Window".

◇ The settlement color describe the percent of sick people in the settlement and the spreading of the COVID-19 virus in it.
  Green color - low than 40% the people are sick.
  Yellow color - 40% - 60% sick people.
  Orange color - 60% - 80% sick people.
  Red color - more than 80% the people are sick.

◇ Time scale above the map in order to control the speed simulation.

◇ "Statistic window" include:
  - "save" button - save the innformation of the table into csv file.
  - "add sick" button  - makes 1% from the settlements' population sick.
  - "add doses" button - in order to add doses to specipic settllement the user selelct to right settlment and click on "add doses".
 
◇ Implemented in Java, using OOP concepts such as design patterns (Factory, Observer/Listener, Memento, proxy etc), polymorphism & interfaces, inheritance etc.
